## Key Decisions (last 10)
- **DESIGN SYSTEM: Option C - Bold Minimal | Primary: #FFE600 (yellow) | BG: #000 | Font: Syne + Outfit** — User selected brutalist high-contrast black & yellow design [design, complete, branding] (2026-02-09T17:00:00+00:00)
- **ARCH: Next.js 14 App Router + Supabase + Solana (memo tx for MVP, Anchor program later)** — Fastest path to ship this week, memo tx avoids program deployment complexity [architecture, decision, tech] (2026-02-09T16:55:00+00:00)
- **DISCOVERY COMPLETE: DISCOVERY.xml generated, validated by user, ready for architecture** — All core requirements gathered, scope defined, constraints understood [discovery, complete, milestone] (2026-02-09T16:53:00+00:00)
- **i18n: English default, next-intl setup from day 1 for easy translation later** — Avoid refactoring later, global audience potential [discovery, interview, tech, i18n] (2026-02-09T16:52:00+00:00)
- **TOKEN STRATEGY: Tease $HABITS, deploy later - track activity off-chain for retroactive airdrop** — Faster MVP, creates FOMO, rewards early adopters, adjust tokenomics based on real data [discovery, interview, token, strategy, gtm] (2026-02-09T16:52:00+00:00)
- **SOLANA XP: User has token/NFT experience, new to Anchor - will learn custom programs** — Calibrate architecture complexity accordingly [discovery, interview, constraints, skills] (2026-02-09T16:51:00+00:00)
- **WALLETS: Solana Wallet Adapter + Phantom (minimum) + Seed Vault (Seeker native)** — Phantom for desktop/testing, Seed Vault for Seeker users [discovery, interview, tech, wallets] (2026-02-09T16:51:00+00:00)
- **TECH STACK: PWA with Next.js - fast to ship, works on Seeker browser, can wrap native later** — Speed to market priority, Seeker has good browser support [discovery, interview, tech, stack] (2026-02-09T16:50:00+00:00)
- **TIMELINE: Launch this week - VIBE CODING mode, ship fast, be ambitious** — Capture SKR farmers while Season 2 is hot, AI-assisted rapid development [discovery, interview, constraints, timeline, vibe-coding] (2026-02-09T16:49:00+00:00)
- **ADMIN PANEL: All tokenomics values must be adjustable (emissions, costs, boosts, rake %) via admin interface** — Economy needs real-time tuning based on user behavior and market conditions [discovery, interview, requirements, admin] (2026-02-09T16:48:00+00:00)
